# The Oracle

What if LLMs can help you predict the future?

The premise of this project is that by thinking about first and [second order consequences](https://fs.blog/second-order-thinking/), you can plan better for the future.
Doing this usually requires a good deal of thinking and mental skills working in concert like creativity and critical thinking.
Even then, it's easy to bias yourself in favour of things you have been thinking about recently and miss things.

I believe that by using LLMs to generate possible consequences en masse, you can reduce cognitive load on yourself significantly while staying true to the core idea.

## Disclaimer

This is a personal project. There are a **huge** number of things I would do differently if I were building this for serious production use.
